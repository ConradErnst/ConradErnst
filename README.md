Hello! I am a research assistant at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Programming Language and Verification Lab in Boulder, Colorado. Earlier, I graduated in Computer Science, Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence from Drake University.

I do work in the areas of machine learning, software development, and verification with a specific emphasis on leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and neurosymbolic AI. I'm passionate about continuous learning and collaboration with others. I created a source for individuals of all backgrounds to learn more about artificial intelligence, what it is, and how it can be of used. You can explore it [here](https://conradernst.github.io/IntroAI.github.io/).

**Overview**  
As part of a collaborative Computer Science capstone project, I contributed to developing an immersive generative AI platform designed to provide college students with a supportive, interactive virtual therapist experience. The project integrated real-time emotion detection, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), synchronized facial animations, and speech synthesis to create a dynamic and responsive conversational environment. I led the model development and integration efforts, including designing and training an LLM for therapeutic dialogue, and utilized APIs for generating AI-driven video and synthesized speech. This platform, inspired by applications like Zoom, reimagined virtual communication with fully generative AI capabilities, enhancing empathetic, real-time interaction.

### RAG-Based Educational Generative AI

**Overview**  
As part of an Advanced NLP course, I developed an educational content generation system utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a pretrained LLM, seamlessly integrated with a knowledge base to enhance the creation of generative lecture material. This system automated the production of topic-specific PowerPoint presentations, enabling efficient generation of college-level content across various subjects. By leveraging RAG, the project advanced the use of personalized, generative educational materials, providing a streamlined approach to instructional content delivery.

**Overview**  
In collaboration with my AI capstone team, I helped develop an interactive web application that illustrates the workings of diffusion-based text-to-image generative AI, offering users an in-depth look into the image creation process. The application features a visual model on the front end, displaying diffused images across various epoch steps and allowing users to adjust hyperparameters and input prompts to experiment with model behavior. This project combined visual aids with explanatory text to enhance user comprehension of complex AI concepts through hands-on exploration.

**Overview**  
In this project, I collaborated with a team of 12 developers to design and build a registration helper desktop application using Python. The project was part of the Software Engineering 188 course, which provided a comprehensive overview of the software engineering field. The course emphasized the full software development lifecycle, various development strategies, testing methodologies, and practical experience in conceiving, specifying, designing, developing, and implementing a robust software solution.
