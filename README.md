I am a research assistant at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Programming Language and Verification Lab in Boulder, Colorado. Earlier, I graduated in Computer Science, Data Analytics, and Aritifical Intelligence from Drake University.

I do work in the areas of machine learning, software development, and verification with a specific emphasis on leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and neurosymbolic AI. 

I'm passionate about continuous learning and collaboration with others. I created a source for individuals of all backgrounds to learn more about artificial intelligence, what it is, and how it can be of use. 


If you'd like to discuss my research, explore potential collaborations or business endeavors, or request a copy of my CV, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm always open to meaningful conversations and opportunities!

### Overview 
As part of a collaborative Computer Science capstone project, I contributed to developing an immersive 
generative AI platform designed to provide college students with a supportive, interactive virtual 
therapist experience. The project integrated real-time emotion detection, a fine-tuned large language 
model (LLM), synchronized facial animations, and speech synthesis to create a dynamic and responsive 
conversational environment. I led the model development and integration efforts, including designing and 
training an LLM for therapeutic dialogue, and utilized APIs for generating AI-driven video and synthesized 
speech. This platform, inspired by applications like Zoom, reimagined virtual communication with fully 
generative AI capabilities, enhancing empathetic, real-time interaction.

### Overview
As part of Advanced NLP course, I developed an educational content generation system utilizing retrieval-augmented 
generation (RAG) with a pretrained LLM, seamlessly integrated with a knowledge base 
to enhance the creation of generative lecture material. This system automated the 
production of topic-specific PowerPoint presentations, enabling efficient generation of 
college-level content across various subjects. By leveraging RAG, the project advanced 
the use of personalized, generative educational materials, providing a streamlined 
approach to instructional content delivery.

### Overview
In collaboration with my AI capstone team, I helped develop an interactive web application that 
illustrates the workings of diffusion-based text-to-image generative AI, offering users an in-depth 
look into the image creation process. The application features a visual model on the front end,
displaying diffused images across various epoch steps and allowing users to adjust hyperparameters 
and input prompts to experiment with model behavior. This project combined visual aids with explanatory 
text to enhance user comprehension of complex AI concepts through hands-on exploration.

### Overview
In this project, I collaborated with a team of 12 developers to design and build a registration helper desktop application 
using Python. The project was part of the Software Engineering 188 course, which provided a comprehensive overview of the 
software engineering field. The course emphasized the full software development lifecycle, various development strategies, 
testing methodologies, and practical experience in conceiving, specifying, designing, developing, and implementing a robust 
software solution.
